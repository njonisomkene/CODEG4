    <h2><i>We Are Not Interested In Government Of Unity - Abure (video) - Politics - </i></h2>
    <hr>
   
    
    <P>The (authentic) National Chairman of Labour Party, Barr. Julius Abure, has stated that the party is not interested in any government of unity as being canvassed by members of the ruling party.</P>

    <P>Mr Abure stated this while playing host to Akpabio, some Senators-elect and other members of the APC who came to solicit the support of the Labour Party in order to emerge as the next senate president of the country in the upcoming 10th National Assembly.</P>

    <P>Mr Abure stated this while playing host to Akpabio, some Senators-elect and other members of the APC who came to solicit the support of the Labour Party in order to emerge as the next senate president of the country in the upcoming 10th National Assembly.</P>
    <P>In the meeting, after stating why they came on the courtesy call, Akpabio made allusion to the pleas of the president-elect for opposition to sheath their sword and support his incoming government to which the National Chairman responded and said that such discussion was “off limit” as the Labour Party is not interested in any such arrangement.</P>

    <p>One however wonders why the APC high echelons chose to visit Barr Abure and not Mr Lamidi Apapa who some elements are cheering on to claim that he is the ‘chairman’ of Labour Party.</p>
