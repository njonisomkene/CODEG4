    <h2 > <i>LP: Court Nullification Of Alex Otti’s Candidature Too Late – Festus Ogun - Politics</i></h2><hr>
    <p><b>A human rights activist, Festus Ogun, has reacted to the Federal High Court ruling which nullified the candidature of the Abia State Governor-elect, Dr Alex Otti and all the candidates of the Labour Party in Abia and Kano states.</b></p>
    <p> DAILY POST had earlier reported that the Federal High Court sitting in Kano, presided over by Justice M N Yunusa, had nullified the candidature of Otti and all the candidates of LP in Abia and Kano.</p>
    <p>The court ruled that their emergence wasn’t in compliance with the provisions of the 2022 Electoral Act.</p>
    <p> Reacting, <strong>Ogun</strong>, in a tweet via his Twitter handle,<strong> branded the court’s judgement as too late, adding that Otti and other LP candidates have been duly elected.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>
        “Too late. They have been duly elected,”</strong> Ogun tweeted.</p>
        <P>“This judgement cannot affect their emergence in any way and cannot be a ground to challenge their emergence at the Tribunal.”</P>
